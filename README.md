# PowerBI-Road Accident Analysis

Introduction

This repository contains the code and files for a Power BI dashboard that analyzes road accident data. The dashboard is designed to help users identify patterns and trends in road accidents, which can then be used to improve road safety.

Data

The data for the dashboard is provided by the UK Department for Transport. The dataset includes information about road accidents that occurred in the UK in 2021. The data includes information about the date, time, location, severity, and number of casualties in each accident.

Dashboard

The dashboard consists of a number of visualizations that allow users to explore the data. The visualizations include:

A map of the UK showing the number of accidents by location
A bar chart showing the number of accidents by Road type
A Donut chart showing the number of casualties by Area
A line chart showing the monthly trend in the number of accidents
DAX Formulas

The dashboard uses a number of DAX formulas to calculate the metrics that are displayed in the visualizations. For example, the CY Casualties measure calculates the total number of casualties in the current year.

Installation and Usage

To install and use the dashboard, you will need to have Power BI Desktop installed. You can download Power BI Desktop from the Microsoft website: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/.

Once you have installed Power BI Desktop, you can open the Road Accidents Analysis.pbix file in the repository. The dashboard will open in Power BI Desktop. You can then explore the data and visualizations by clicking on the different tabs in the dashboard.
